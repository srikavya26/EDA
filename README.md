### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Sales Data
#### Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset (sales.csv) using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, and calmap. The aim is to uncover insights and trends in the sales data through visualizations and statistical analysis. Additionally, a comprehensive profile report is generated for a detailed overview of the dataset.
#### Libraries Used
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
- matplotlib.pyplot: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- calmap: For creating heatmaps of time series data.
- pandas_profiling: For generating a detailed profile report of the dataset.
#### Results and Insights
- Performed univariate analysis to understand the distribution and central tendency of individual variables.
- Conducted bivariate analysis to explore relationships between pairs of variables, such as sales by product and region.
- Predictive modeling to forecast future sales trends.
- Time series analysis revealed seasonal sales trends.
- Correlation analysis identified key factors affecting sales and the strength of their relationships.
- Product category and region significantly influence sales patterns.
####  Profile Report
##### A comprehensive profile report is generated using pandas_profiling, providing an in-depth overview of the dataset including:
- Dataset overview.
- Variable types and their distributions.
- Missing values and data quality.
- Descriptive statistics.
#### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
``` bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib calmap pandas-profiling
```
#### Running the Analysis
#### Clone the Repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/srikavya26/EDA.git
cd EDA
```
##### Jupyter Notebook
- Open the EDA.ipynb notebook in Jupyter to explore the EDA step-by-step.

*Profile Report*
- Open the Sales_Profile_Report.html in a web browser to view the detailed profile report of the sales dataset.

#### Conclusion
This EDA provides valuable insights into the sales data, aiding in data-driven decision-making and strategic planning. The visualizations and detailed profile report enhance the understanding of sales dynamics, helping stakeholders to identify key trends and patterns.
